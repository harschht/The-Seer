% Define Variables:

% htx = 50 - Model is based on transmitter (Tx) height htx in meters
% hrx = 1.5 - Model is based on receiver (Rx) height hrx in meters
ptx = 44; % Tx output power in dBm, equals 25W.
v = 1; % Variance (noise)
lambda = (3* 10^8) / f; % Wavelength in meters

% Random Distance Generator:
% Below are the possible distances that our Tx could be from the Rx, in cm.
x = randperm(1400,500); % N random #s that do not repeat between 1-1400 
% Exlude numbers under 125 cm (too close to base station)
for i=(1:length(x))
